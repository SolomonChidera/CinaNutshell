# Keywords in C Programming

Keywords are reserved words in the C programming language that have specific meanings and functionalities. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) within your program.

Here are some essential keywords in C:

## Data Types
- `int`: Represents integer data type.
- `float`: Represents floating-point data type.
- `char`: Represents character data type.
- `double`: Represents double-precision floating-point data type.
- `short`: Represents a short integer data type.
- `long`: Represents a long integer data type.
- `unsigned`: Used with data types to represent only positive values.

## Control Flow
- `if`: Used for conditional branching.
- `else`: Used with `if` to provide an alternative branch.
- `switch`: Used for multi-way branching based on a value.
- `case`: Used within `switch` to specify possible values.
- `default`: Used within `switch` for the default branch.
- `while`: Used for creating a loop that executes while a condition is true.
- `for`: Used for creating a loop with initialization, condition, and iteration expressions.
- `do`: Used with `while` to create a loop that executes at least once.
- `break`: Used to exit loops or switch statements.
- `continue`: Used to skip the rest of the loop iteration and move to the next iteration.

## Functions
- `return`: Used to return a value from a function.
- `void`: Indicates that a function does not return a value.
- `main`: The entry point of a C program.

## Storage Classes
- `auto`: Default storage class for local variables.
- `register`: Suggests the compiler to store a variable in a CPU register.
- `static`: Preserves the value of a variable across function calls.
- `extern`: Declares a global variable or function that is defined in another file.

## Miscellaneous
- `sizeof`: Returns the size in bytes of a data type or variable.
- `typedef`: Used to create a new type name for existing data types.
- `enum`: Defines an enumeration type.
- `struct`: Defines a structure type.
- `union`: Defines a union type which can hold multiple types of data.

Remember that using these keywords as identifiers will result in a compilation error. Also, C is case-sensitive, so `if` and `IF` are treated as different identifiers.

For more information on these keywords and their usage, refer to the C programming language documentation.
